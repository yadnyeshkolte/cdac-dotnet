# C# Programming Assignments Overview

This repository contains the problem statements and requirements for four distinct C# programming assignments. Below is a breakdown of the tasks required for each module.

## Assignment 1: Basic Calculations and Logic
**Focus:** Basic arithmetic, conditional logic (`if`), and unit conversion.

* [cite_start]**Area of Circle:** Write a C# program to calculate the "area of circle" based on a given "radius" value[cite: 2].
    * [cite_start]*Note:* The requirement specifies the radius is 3.14[cite: 2].
* [cite_start]**Height Category:** Write a program using `if` statements to determine a person's "category of height" based on their input height in inches[cite: 3].
    * [cite_start]**Conversion:** You must convert the input value (inches) into centimeters[cite: 5].
    * [cite_start]**Formula:** $$1 \text{ inch} = 2.54 \text{ centimeters}$$[cite: 4].
* [cite_start]**Nearest Thousands:** Write a C# program to calculate the nearest thousands of a specific integer input named "number"[cite: 6].

## Assignment 2: Medical Bot and Type Conversion
**Focus:** Console interaction, arguments, and data type conversion.

* [cite_start]**Medical Bot Application:** Create a console application acting as a medical bot named "Bob"[cite: 16, 17].
    * [cite_start]**Functionality:** The bot must prescribe medication based on a patient's symptoms and age[cite: 16].
    * [cite_start]**Input:** Symptoms should be passed as arguments[cite: 17].
* [cite_start]**Type Conversion:** Write simple C# code that converts various values from one data type to another[cite: 18].

## Assignment 3: Object-Oriented Programming and Collections
**Focus:** Classes, Collections, and Interfaces.

* [cite_start]**Car Rental System:** Create a simple program modeling a car rental agency[cite: 8].
    * [cite_start]**Data Models:** The collection of cars must include properties for make, model, rental price, and availability status[cite: 8].
* [cite_start]**Large Number Search:** Write a program containing a method to find large numbers within a group of collections[cite: 9].
* [cite_start]**Interfaces Demo:** Create a console application that specifically demonstrates the usage of interfaces and collections[cite: 10].

## Assignment 4: Advanced C# Concepts
**Focus:** Delegates, Events, and Application Architecture.

* [cite_start]**News Feed Application:** Implement a console application demonstrating the use of delegates and events[cite: 12, 13].
    * [cite_start]**Components:** You must create a `NewsArticle` class and a `NewsArticleCollection` class[cite: 14].
    * **Functionality:**
        * [cite_start]Filter news articles by category[cite: 14].
        * [cite_start]Notify subscribers when new articles are added to or removed from the collection[cite: 14].
